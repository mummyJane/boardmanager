- Use JSON for the first iteration of board definitions to keep review and scripting simple.
- Use generated C headers and C source stubs as the firmware integration layer for the first milestone.
- Keep the first milestone dependency-light by using a plain Node.js generator script with no third-party packages.
- Reserve `project/web` and `project/device-manager` for later milestones instead of prematurely scaffolding framework-specific stacks.
- Commit generated firmware artifacts so schema and API-surface changes stay reviewable in git.
